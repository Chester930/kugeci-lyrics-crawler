If you really want to optimize your methods you need to understand how time is measured in this game. This unlock is all about that.

There are two useful functions to measure how long things take:

get_time() returns the time in seconds since the start of the game.

get_tick_count() returns the number of ticks performed since the start of execution.

These two functions as well as quick_print(), are completely free. Even the call operation is free for them.
